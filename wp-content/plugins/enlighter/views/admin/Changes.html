<li>Changed: release scheme to <a href="https://semver.org/" rel="nofollow">Semantic Versioning</a></li>
<li>Bugfix: some development files (EnlighterJS v3 prelease) got into the release branch (lowercase filenames) this may cause some issues during the plugin upgrade - I apologize for the inconvenience - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EnlighterJS/Plugin.WordPress/issues/119">aguidrevitch on GitHub</a></li>
